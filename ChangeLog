10/12/2004:
	- thrown out files related part of GLUI GUI so it don't segfault

19/02/2003:
	- *** Shame on me !!!!!!!!! ***
	The gravitational calculs were all FALSES until today :/
	The 'full N-body' was just wrong (see algo.trace) !

18/02/2003:
	- modified Makefile to optimize archive generation
	- modified initialisation sequence for logic and clarity and so you
	can switch back to window when starting fullscreen
	- replaced macro TITRE, dispatched (is this word existing in english ?)
	the informations in APP_NAME, MAJOR, MINOR, REVISION and LANGUAGE
	(see config.h if you don't undersand wath I mean here)

15/01/2003:
	- replaced some macros by inlines functions, it seems to optimize even
	more !

14/12/2002:
	- Erased two obsoletes functions in es.h : askAndLoadFile &
	stdout_output (scream out loud to me if you want them back)

13/12/2002:
	- Big clean-up began
	- separated struct switches in two structs between those related with
	gravity engine or gui (globalvars.h)
	- Oops... src/parseargs.h disappeared... didn't see the need for it to
	be apart anymore, the parsing function goes in main.cpp, global vars
	in globalvars.h

01/12/2002:
	- grouped all "switches" into a struct (globalvars.h)
	- added 'q' and 'Q' to quit (glutstuff.h)

	- modified 'make archive' so the .tar.bz2/.gz extract to a
	sub-directory instead of ./

	- fixed a bug that caused SegFault on opening a non-existing file.
